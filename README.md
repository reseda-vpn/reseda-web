### reseda-web

Reseda VPN Website and javascipt API endpoint. Here, the HTTP routes for https://reseda.app are served.

This is handled as a next-js server which integrates the database to display all stored user data. Note, any and all data stored about any user can be observed through UI, there is no information intentionally hidden from any user.

This integrates with the reseda client which shares UI themes and culminated ideologies, although at different stages of development.

A few legacy routes here are to be closed in the near future to prevent unauthorised routes from accessing core data or services.
